    "EleutherAI released GPT-J 6B, an open-source alternative to [OpenAIs GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is the 6 billion parameter successor to EleutherAIs GPT-NEO family, a family of transformer-based language models based on the GPT architecture for text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "EleutherAI's primary goal is to train a model that is equivalent in size to GPT⁠-⁠3 and make it available to the public under an open license.\n",
    "Over the last few months, GPT-J gained a lot of interest from Researchers, Data Scientists, and even Software Developers, but it remained very challenging to fine tune GPT-J.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of the 6 billion parameter model represent a ~24GB memory footprint. To load it in float32, one would need at least 2x model size CPU RAM: 1x for initial weights and another 1x to load the checkpoint. Apart from the model parameters, there are the gradients, optimizer states, and activations taking memory, so the actual memory usage might be significantly higher than 48GB. Just as an example, with Adam optimizer and FP32 training, the use from parameters, gradients and optimizer states might be 96GB+, and activation memory footprint would be even more than this, so the total memory usage might be easily larger than 200 GB.\n",

    "1. `train_gptj_smp_script.py`: This is an entrypoint script that is passed to the PyTorch estimator in the notebook instructions. This script is responsible for end to end training of the GPT-J model with SMP. The script has additional comments at places where the SMP API is used.\n",
    "2. `fp16`: This folder is used for 16-bit float training, which contains a fp16 optimizer and various fp16 utilities.\n",
    "3. `learning_rates.py`: This contains the functions for learning rate schedule.\n",
    "4. `requirements.txt`: This will install the dependencies, like the right version of huggingface transformers.\n",

    "## SageMaker Distributed Training \n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker provides distributed training libraries for data parallelism and model parallelism. The libraries are optimized for the SageMaker training environment, help adapt your distributed training jobs to SageMaker, and improve training speed and throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "![SageMaker Distributed Training Approaches](img/TypesOfDistributedTraining.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMaker Model Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism is the process of splitting a model up between multiple devices or nodes (such as GPU-equipped instances) and creating an efficient pipeline to train the model across these devices to maximize GPU utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing deep learning model size (layers and parameters) can result in better accuracy. However, there is a limit to the maximum model size you can fit in a single GPU. When training deep learning models, GPU memory limitations can be a bottleneck in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can limit the size of the model you train. Given that larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, this directly translates to trained model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They can limit the batch size you train with, leading to lower GPU utilization and slower training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations associated with training a model on a single GPU, you can use model parallelism to distribute and train your model on multiple computing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core features of SageMaker Model Parallel \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Automated Model Splitting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): When you use SageMaker's model parallel library, you can take advantage of automated model splitting, also referred to as automated model partitioning. The library uses a partitioning algorithm that balances memory, minimizes communication between devices, and optimizes performance. You can configure the automated partitioning algorithm to optimize for speed or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Pipeline Execution Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): A core feature of SageMaker's distributed model parallel library is pipelined execution, which determines the order in which computations are made and data is processed across devices during model training. Pipelining is a technique to achieve true parallelization in model parallelism, by having the GPUs compute simultaneously on different data samples, and to overcome the performance loss due to sequential computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelining is based on splitting a mini-batch into microbatches, which are fed into the training pipeline one-by-one and follow an execution schedule defined by the library runtime. A microbatch is a smaller subset of a given training mini-batch. The pipeline schedule determines which microbatch is executed by which device for every time slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its [core features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html), the SageMaker distributed model parallel library offers [memory-saving features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch.html) for training deep learning models with PyTorch: [tensor parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html), [optimizer state sharding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-optimizer-state-sharding.html), [activation checkpointing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-checkpointing.html), and [activation offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-offloading.html).

    "As we are going to use PyTorch and Hugging Face for training GPT-J, it is important to understand all the SageMaker Distributed configuration parameters specific to PyTorch [here](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smd_model_parallel_general.html#pytorch-specific-parameters).\n",

    "#### Important\n",
    "\n",
    "`process_per_host` must not be greater than the number of GPUs per instance and typically will be equal to the number of GPUs per instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use one instance with 4-way pipeline parallelism and 2-way data parallelism, then processes_per_host should be 2 x 4 = 8. Therefore, you must choose an instance that has at least 8 GPUs, such as an ml.p3.16xlarge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image illustrates how 4-way data parallelism and 2-way pipeline parallelism is distributed across 8 GPUs: the models is partitioned across 2 GPUs, and each partition is added to 4 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to understand how the [ranking mechanism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-ranking-mechanism.html) of model parallelism works with tensor parallelism.
